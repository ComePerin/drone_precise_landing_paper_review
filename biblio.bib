  abstract={Robotic simulators are crucial for academic research and education as well as the development of safety-critical applications. Reinforcement learning environments— simple simulations coupled with a problem specification in the form of a reward function—are also important to standardize the development (and benchmarking) of learning algorithms. Yet, full-scale simulators typically lack portability and paral-lelizability. Vice versa, many reinforcement learning environments trade-off realism for high sample throughputs in toy-like problems. While public data sets have greatly benefited deep learning and computer vision, we still lack the software tools to simultaneously develop—and fairly compare—control theory and reinforcement learning approaches. In this paper, we propose an open-source OpenAI Gym-like environment for multiple quadcopters based on the Bullet physics engine. Its multi-agent and vision-based reinforcement learning interfaces, as well as the support of realistic collisions and aerodynamic effects, make it, to the best of our knowledge, a first of its kind. We demonstrate its use through several examples, either for control (trajectory tracking with PID control, multi-robot flight with downwash, etc.) or reinforcement learning (single and multi-agent stabilization tasks), hoping to inspire future research that combines control theory and machine learning.},

@article{Ramanathan2022,
   abstract = {Demand is expected to accelerate for autonomous air vehicles that transport people and goods, making wind sensors on these vehicles and in the air space where they operate critical to ensure safe control of many simultaneous take-offs and landings. Conventional anemometers such as pitot tubes as well as rotating, heated-element, acoustic, and drag technologies have drawbacks for small and micro-aerial vehicles including high power consumption, high aerodynamic drag, complex signal processing, and high cost. This paper presents an airfoil-shaped anemometer that provides low drag while integrating sensors for measuring wind speed and direction on tethered kites, balloons, and drones. Wind speed is measured by an integrated dual-layer capacitive pressure sensor with a polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) diaphragm while wind direction is measured by a 3D digital magnetometer that senses the orientation of the airfoil relative to the earth’s magnetic field. A model is presented for a dual-layer capacitive sensor and validated through quasistatic pressure chamber testing. The capacitive sensor as well as a commercial digital magnetometer are integrated into a NACA 2412 profile airfoil and tested in a laboratory-scale wind tunnel. The capacitive sensor provides a sensitivity of 1.84 fF m2s−2 and the airfoil exhibits a unique stable angle-of-attack to within ±2° as measured by the magnetometer.},

@article{Zhong2020,
   abstract = {This paper introduces an approach for and the challenges in employing unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) for material handling in the emerging industrial custom manufacturing environments. Compared with conventional industrial robotic systems, UAVs offer enhanced flexibility for the design and on-the-fly variation of the pathways and workflow to optimally perform multiple tasks on demand, besides offering favorable cost and dimensional footprint factors. A fundamental challenge to the deployment of UAVs in manufacturing and other indoor industrial settings lies in ensuring the accuracy of a drone's localization and flight path. Earlier approaches based on using multiple sensors (e.g., GPS, IMU) to improve the localization accuracy of UAVs are considered ineffective in indoor environments. In fact, few investigations have tackled the issues arising due to the limited space and complicated components and moving entities, human presence in shop-floor environments. Towards addressing this challenge, a pose estimation method that employs just a single camera onboard with a UAV, together with multiple ArUco markers positioned strategically over the shop-floor is implemented to track the real-time location of a UAV. A Kalman filter is applied to mitigate noise effects for pose estimation. To assess the performance of this method, several experiments were carried out in Texas A&M University's manufacturing labs. The result suggests that Kalman filter can reduce the variance of pose estimation by 88.48 % compared to a conventional camera and marker-based motion tracking method (∼ 27 cm), and can localize (via averaging) the position to within 8 cm of the actual target location.},

@article{studied,
   abstract = {We propose a novel framework for achieving precision landing in drone services. The proposed framework consists of two distinct decoupled modules, each designed to address a specific aspect of landing accuracy. The first module is concerned with intrinsic errors, where new error models are introduced. This includes a spherical error model that takes into account the orientation of the drone. Additionally, we propose a live position correction algorithm that employs the error models to correct for intrinsic errors in real time. The second module focuses on external wind forces and presents an aerodynamics model with wind generation to simulate the drone’s physical environment. We utilize reinforcement learning to train the drone in simulation with the goal of landing precisely under dynamic wind conditions. Experimental results, conducted through simulations and validated in the physical world, demonstrate that our proposed framework significantly increases landing accuracy while maintaining a low onboard computational cost.},

   abstract = {Indoor drone or Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) operations, automated or with pilot control, are an upcoming and exciting subset of drone use cases. Automated indoor flights tighten the requirements of stability and localization accuracy in comparison with the classic outdoor use cases which rely primarily on (RTK) GNSS for localization. In this paper the effect of multiple sensors on 3D indoor position accuracy is investigated using the flexible sensor fusion platform OASE. This evaluation is based on real-life drone flights in an industrial lab with mm-accurate ground truth measurements provided by motion capture cameras, allowing the evaluation of the sensors based on their deviation from the ground truth in 2D and 3D. The sensors under consideration for this research are: IMU, sonar, SLAM camera, ArUco markers and Ultra-Wideband (UWB) positioning with up to 6 anchors. The paper demonstrates that using this setup, the achievable 2D (3D) indoor localization error varies between 4.4 cm and 21 cm (4.9 cm and 67.2 cm) depending on the selected set of sensors. Furthermore, cost/accuracy trade-offs are included to indicate the relative importance of different sensor combinations depending on the (engineering) budget and use case. These lab results were validated in a Proof of Concept deployment of an inventory scanning drone with more than 10 flight hours in a 65 000 m 2 warehouse. By combining lab results and real-life deployment experiences, different subsets of sensors are presented as a minimal viable solution for three different indoor use cases considering accuracy and cost: a large drone with little weight-and cost restrictions, one or more medium sized drones, and a swarm of weight and cost restricted nano drones.},

@article{Cocchioni2016,
   abstract = {One of the main challenges for Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAVs) is to extend the endurance of small vehicles such as multi-rotors. Actually, Li-po batteries that guarantee a flight of about 20 min power this type of vehicles. The endurance can be extended by enabling vehicles to look for recharging station(s). In this paper, we propose a vision system able to detect and track a given pattern hosted on the target-landing platform. The pattern is also useful to estimate the UAV position while approaching the target or during the hovering close to the target. The paper focuses on an optimized adaptive thresholding technique that manages critical situations as changes in the scene’s illumination / shadows. The developed system runs at 90 Hz for processing a 752×480 grayscale image. Preliminary results on an NVidia Tegra Jetson K1 platform are also presented to distribute the computation between CPU and GPU.},

In the first part, we develop an architectural philosophy to obtain a more detailed reliability evaluation; then, we study the intrinsic reliability at the design stage in order to avoid severe critical issues in the UAV. In the second part, we compare different maintenance philosophies for UAVs and develop the concepts of preventive and corrective maintenance that consider the system subjected (until real “hard failure”) to partial performance degradation (“soft failure”). Finally, by evaluation of the uncertainty through the confidence interval, we determine the new soft failure limits, taking into account the general knowledge of the systems and subsystems in order to guarantee the proper preventive maintenance interval.},

   abstract = {Reinforcement learning offers to robotics a framework and set of tools for the design of sophisticated and hard-to-engineer behaviors. Conversely, the challenges of robotic problems provide both inspiration, impact, and validation for developments in reinforcement learning. The relationship between disciplines has sufficient promise to be likened to that between physics and mathematics. In this article, we attempt to strengthen the links between the two research communities by providing a survey of work in reinforcement learning for behavior generation in robots. We highlight both key challenges in robot reinforcement learning as well as notable successes. We discuss how contributions tamed the complexity of the domain and study the role of algorithms, representations, and prior knowledge in achieving these successes. As a result, a particular focus of our paper lies on the choice between model-based and model-free as well as between value-function-based and policy-search methods. By analyzing a simple problem in some detail we demonstrate how reinforcement learning approaches may be profitably applied, and we note throughout open questions and the tremendous potential for future research. © The Author(s) 2013.},
